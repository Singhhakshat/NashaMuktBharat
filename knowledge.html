      <h1>What’s the definition of addiction?</h1>
      <p>An addiction is a chronic dysfunction of the brain system that involves reward, motivation, and memory. It’s about the way your body craves a substance or behavior, especially if it causes a compulsive or obsessive pursuit of “reward” and lack of concern over consequences. <br>Someone experiencing an addiction will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>be unable stay away from the substance or stop the addictive behavior</li>
        <li>display a lack of self-control</li>
        <li>have an increased desire for the substance or behavior</li>
        <li>dismiss how their behavior may be causing problems</li>
        <li>lack an emotional response</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h1>What are the signs?</h1>
      <p>Most signs of addiction relate to a person’s impaired ability to maintain self-control. This includes changes that are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>social, such as seeking out situations that encourage a substance or behavior</li>
        <li>behavioral, such increased secrecy</li>
        <li>health related, such as insomnia or memory loss</li>
        <li>increased levels of anxiety, depression, and sadness</li>
        <li>increased sensitivity and more severe reactions to stress</li>
        <li>trouble identifying feelings</li>
        <li>trouble telling the difference between feelings and the physical sensations of one’s emotions </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>What causes addiction?</h1>
      <p>Addictive substances and behaviors can create a pleasurable “high” that’s physical and psychological. You’ll typically use more of certain substances or engage in behaviors longer to achieve the same high again. Over time, the addiction becomes difficult to stop.</p>
      <h2>The brain</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Some people may try a substance or behavior and never approach it again, while others become addicted. This is partially due to the brain’s frontal lobes. The frontal lobe allows a person to delay feelings of reward or gratification. In addiction, the frontal lobe malfunctions and gratification is immediate.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Additional areas of the brain may also play a role in addiction. The anterior cingulate cortex and the nucleus accumbens, which is associated with pleasurable sensations, can increase a person’s response when exposed to addictive substances and behaviors.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Other possible causes of addiction include chemical imbalances in the brain and mental disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These disorders can lead to coping strategies that become addictions.</p>
      <h2>Early exposure</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Experts believe that repeated and early exposure to addictive substances and behaviors play a significant role. Genetics also increase the likelihood of an addiction by about 50 percent,</p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Environment and culture also play a role in how a person responds to a substance or behavior. A lack or disruption in a person’s social support system can lead to substance or behavioral addiction. Traumatic experiences that affect coping abilities can also lead to addictive behaviors.</p>

      <h1>What are the stages?</h1>
      <p>Addiction will often play out in stages. Your brain and body’s reactions at early stages of addiction are different from reactions during the later stages. <br> The four stages of addiction are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>experimentation: uses or engages out of curiosity</li>
        <li>social or regular: uses or engages in social situations or for social reasons</li>
        <li>problem or risk: uses or engages in an extreme way with disregard for consequences</li>
        <li>dependency: uses or engages in a behavior on a daily basis, or several times per day, despite possible negative consequences</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h1>What are the complications?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>physical, such as heart disease, HIV/AIDS, and neurological damage</li>
        <li>psychological and emotional, such as anxiety, stress, and depression</li>
        <li>Risk of heart attack, stroke and seizures</li>
        <li>Risk of damage to liver, lungs, liver and kidneys from long-term use</li>
        <li> Risk of impairment in memory, learning, problem solving and concentration; risk of psychosis — such as schizophrenia, hallucination or paranoia — later in life associated with early and frequent use</li>
      </ul>
